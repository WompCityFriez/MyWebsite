    <blockquote><h3>Bio</h3>
        <p> Hello!</p>

            <p>My name is <b>Kenadi Adams</b>, and I am currently a high school student enrolled at <b>Ohio Virtual Academy (OHVA)</b>. While I am not currently employed, I am actively seeking an internship in Graphic Design and plan to pursue paid commissions as a side venture in the future.
            
            I have been part of the <b>Interactive Media</b> CTE pathway for over a year, during which I have gained valuable insights into the graphic design profession. I come from a family of six, where I am one of two daughters, and I have always had a strong interest in art. My passion for digital art began during the early stages of the 2019-2020 pandemic when I started experimenting with my older brotherâ€™s iPad and the app Procreate. Initially unaware of the scope of digital art, I immersed myself in learning more about it and soon realized it was a field I was deeply passionate about.
            
            For years, I struggled with the common question, "What do you want to be when you grow up?" But through exploration and dedication, I discovered that hobbies can transform into careers in ways you never anticipate. The Interactive Media CTE pathway has opened many doors for me, and I am grateful for the opportunities it has provided. I am committed to continuously learning and exploring new skills in the graphic design field, eager to uncover additional talents and expand my capabilities.
            </p>

     <h3>My Favorite Shows</h3>
     <dl>
        <dt><b>The Good Place</b></dt>
        <dd>When Eleanor Shellstrop<span>Kirsten Bell</span> finds herself in the afterlife, she's both relieved and surprised that she's made it into the Good Place. But it doesn't take long for Eleanor to realize she's there by mistake. 
            She hides in plain sight from the Good Place's architect, Michael <span>Ted Danson</span>,and his all-knowing assistant, Janet <span>D'Arcy Carden</span>. Her seemingly perfect neighbors, Tahani <span>Jameela Jamil</span> and Jason <span>Manny Jacinto</span>, and open-hearted soul mate, Chidi <span>William Jackson Harper</span>, help her realize that it's never too late to change. 
            With the help of her new friends -- and a few enemies -- Eleanor becomes determined to shed her old way of life in hopes of discovering a new one in the afterlife.
        </dd>
        
        <dt><strong>Santa Clarita Diet</strong></dt>
        <dd><span>Drew Barrymore</span> and <span>Timothy Olyphant</span> star in this Netflix-original series as married realtors, Sheila and Joel, who are living a quiet life, raising their teenage daughter in Santa Clarita, Calif. 
            Their world unexpectedly changes when Sheila goes through a dramatic transformation that sends her down a road of death and destruction -- but leaves her looking and feeling better than ever. 
            Barrymore and Olyphant also serve as executive producers, alongside showrunner and creator Victor Fresco ("Better Off Ted").</dd>

            <dt><strong>Jane The Virgin</strong>
            <dd>The daughter of a teen mother, Jane Villanueva grew up determined not to repeat her mom's mistakes. At 23, her life is on track; Jane is studying to be a teacher and engaged to a handsome detective who supports her decision to remain a virgin until marriage. Then a routine clinic visit flips her life upside down. 
                Inseminated by a specimen meant for a patient in the next room, now-pregnant Jane is in a situation made only more insane when she learns that the sperm donor is her boss, Rafael. As her meticulously planned life gets more like the telenovelas she loves, she faces a lot of complicated decisions about where to go from here.</dd>
