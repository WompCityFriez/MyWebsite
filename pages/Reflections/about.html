    <blockquote><h3>Bio</h3>
        <p> Hello! My name is Kenadi Adams, and I am currently enrolled in OHVA as a highschool student. I currently am unemployed, however I plan to get an internship as a Graphic Designer, and do paid commissions as a side job in my future. 
            I have been in a CTE pathway for Interactive Media for a little longer than a year now and have learned so much about what it means to be a graphic designer.
            I am in a family of six people, being one of the two daughters.  I have always had an interest with art, and during when the pandemic first started (2019/2020), I grew an interest for digital art, starting with just an old ipad and an app called 'Procreate'. I had not known exactly what digital art was, until I fully immersed myself in research about it.
             Eventually, I knew this was what I was passionate about, after years of pondering the age old question asked by many, "What do you want to be when you grow up". I would always think to myself when asked this "How in the world am I supposed to know?" 
             It's a tough question for many, but I've learned that you find hobbies in life, that you never think could be anything more in the moment, until you do. After finding the Interactive Media CTE pathway, it sparked many opportunities for me, for which I am and will always be grateful for. 
             I am constantly trying to learn more, and discover other talents in this field I may have, or would like to learn.
            I have and will continue to explore all of the possibilities that I can achieve with it. 
            </p>
            <p>You can reach me with my OHVA email, (Kenadia2150@ohva.org), My personal email, (Knirell1985@icloud.com), or My personal phone number (440-661-8731)

     <h3>My Favorite Shows</h3>
     <dl>
        <dt><b>The Good Place</b></dt>
        <dd>When Eleanor Shellstrop<span>Kirsten Bell</span> finds herself in the afterlife, she's both relieved and surprised that she's made it into the Good Place. But it doesn't take long for Eleanor to realize she's there by mistake. 
            She hides in plain sight from the Good Place's architect, Michael <span>Ted Danson</span>,and his all-knowing assistant, Janet <span>D'Arcy Carden</span>. Her seemingly perfect neighbors, Tahani <span>Jameela Jamil</span> and Jason <span>Manny Jacinto</span>, and open-hearted soul mate, Chidi <span>William Jackson Harper</span>, help her realize that it's never too late to change. 
            With the help of her new friends -- and a few enemies -- Eleanor becomes determined to shed her old way of life in hopes of discovering a new one in the afterlife.
