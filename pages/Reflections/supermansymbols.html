    <p><b>About This Project</b></p>
    <p style="background-color: rgba(192, 159, 128, 0.678)">
        This assignment taught me the significance of typography and how font choices can evoke a specific time period, like the 1920s. 
        It enhanced my understanding of how typography can influence design and how various text modifications can accentuate a topic. 
        Additionally, I gained valuable experience with Adobe Illustrator, particularly in manipulating and transforming text. 
        Although challenging at times, this assignment improved my creativity and resilience when tackling difficult tasks.

        <div id= "paragraph"><p>While working on my <b>Interactive Media</b> CTE class project, I learned how to create Superman symbols using Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. I focused on mastering the tools and techniques needed to design the iconic logo, ensuring the lines, shapes, and colors were perfectly aligned to capture its essence. In Illustrator, I used the pen tool to craft precise geometric shapes, while Photoshop helped me fine-tune the color gradients and add texture to the design. This project gave me hands-on experience with both programs, allowing me to enhance my skills in logo creation, image manipulation, and typography, all while maintaining a strong attention to detail and staying true to the original design.</div></p> 
            
            <div id="para2"><p>Additionally, I learned the importance of balancing text and visuals to ensure readability while also capturing attention. 
            This project helped me refine my design skills and reinforced the importance of attention to detail in creating professional, effective marketing materials.I also had the opportunity to explore various tools in Adobe Illustrator while learning how to import custom assets. This experience allowed me to refine my design workflow and deepen my understanding of how to integrate personal elements into my projects.</div></p>
